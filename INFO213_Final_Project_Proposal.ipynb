In this project, our primary objective is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the risk factors associated with Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) and create predictive models that can assess an individual's susceptibility to these conditions based on their personal lifestyle factors. Cardiovascular diseases are a significant health issue for millions around the world. Existing health conditions and lifestyle factors play a crucial role in determining an individual's vulnerability to CVDs, and understanding these factors is essential for future outlook. Taking data from the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a dataset with 308,854 records and 19 variables specifically related to lifestyle factors that have commonly been associated with an increased risk of various cardiovascular diseases was published. By analyzing the dataset, we can not only pinpoint high-risk populations, identify trends, and formulate health suggestions, but we can also create machine learning models and predictive models to predict the risk of CVDs based on personal lifestyle factors.\n","\n","Here are the objectives of our project:\n","\n","\n","*   Create K-Nearest Neighbor classification model for predictive analyses\n","*   Create Random Forest Classifier for predictive analyses\n","*   Create Naive Bayes classification model for predictive analyses\n","*   Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of our models\n","*   Visualize the results of our machine learning and predictive models\n","*   Compare our models and analyze their effectiveness\n","*   Discover and analyze the key attributes associated with CVD risk prediction\n","*   Publish and share our results with interested parties (related companies, organizations, or the general public)\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"E3F98oer1utB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2xw2aN9RPhSp"},"source":["### 2.

It is no surprise that AI has a variety of applications in many different fields, medicine included.

Reducing the burden on these experts by allowing artificial intelligence to pick up the slack allows them to spend less time on trivial issues.\n","\n","We aim to show that while large volumes of data may be required, it is not necessary to invest huge amounts of resources into developing complex learning algorithms to make an impact in common medical tasks.

Identifying Key Risk Factors\n","\n","After engaging in EDA, as well as researching the common causes of cardiovasular diseases according to trusted sources such as the CDC, the National Health Service, and the World Health Organization, we were able to get a relative understanding of possible leading factors to the development of CVDs.
