# Cardiovascular-Diseases-Risk-Prediction

INFO 213 Data Science Programming II | Summer 2023 | Final Project

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) using a few selected risk factors and to identify which of these factors are the most significant. A key objective of this project is to gain a solid understanding of the CRISP-DM framework and the overall data science life cycle.
